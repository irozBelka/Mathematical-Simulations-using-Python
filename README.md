# Mathematical Simulations Using Python

This repository contains various mathematical simulations and visualizations implemented using Python. The following sections present different types of visualizations performed using **Matplotlib** and the **Probability Analysis** methods, including scatter plots, histograms, line plots, multivariate functions, and more.

## Probability Analysis

### Bernoulli Distribution

This plot visualizes the **Bernoulli distribution**, used in probability theory to model random variables with two possible outcomes, often representing success or failure.

## Matplotlib Visualizations

This section showcases different types of visualizations created using the **Matplotlib** library to better understand data patterns and relationships.

### Scatter Plot

The **scatter plot** illustrates the relationship between two variables. In this case, we plot random values for both X and Y axes, showing the distribution of points.

### Histograms

The **histogram** provides a visual representation of the frequency distribution of data. It allows for easy interpretation of the data's distribution.

### Line Plot

The **line plot** visualizes the relationship between two variables over a continuous range. It's useful for showing trends over time or other continuous measurements.

### Multiplot

This **multiplot** combines multiple plots in a single figure to compare different visualizations side-by-side, making it easier to compare distributions or relationships in data.

### Bar Chart

The **bar chart** is used to compare categories of data by representing each category with a bar. It's helpful for showing comparisons between different groups or values.

## Analysis
### Multivariable Function

This **Multivariable Function** provides a visual representation of the function f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates various mathematical simulations and visualizations using Python. By utilizing libraries such as **Matplotlib** and implementing probability analysis techniques, we can gain better insights into data and distributions. Each plot type has its own advantages and can be chosen based on the specific data or problem being analyzed.
